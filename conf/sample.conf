# ==========================================
# Sing-Box Gateway Configuration
# ==========================================

# --- 1. Physical Interface ---
# The interface where the Gateway IP will reside.
PHY_IF=ens192

# The IP assigned to this gateway (Entry Point).
GATEWAY_IP=192.168.10.5

# --- 2. Upstream Proxy ---
# Supported: socks5://, http://, vmess://, trojan://, ss://, vless://
PROXY_URL=socks5://192.168.4.5:10818

# --- 3. Protocol Settings ---
# Wrap UDP in TCP (Useful for restrictive proxies).
UDP_OVER_TCP=false

# --- 4. Network Tuning ---
# TCP MSS Clamping. Prevents packet drops and SSL/TLS hangs.
# Default: 1300 (Safe for most tunnels)
MSS_VAL=1300

# --- 5. Advanced Features ---
# [Multiplexing]
# Combines concurrent TCP requests.
ENABLE_MUX=false
MUX_CONCURRENCY=8

# [FakeDNS]
# Returns fake IPs (198.18.x.x) to clients instantly.
# Resolves DNS remotely upon connection.
ENABLE_FAKEDNS=false

# --- 6. Client Filtering ---
# Optional: Restrict this tunnel to a specific Client IP (e.g. 192.168.1.50).
# If empty, this gateway accepts ALL traffic entering PHY_IF.
# CLIENT_IP=

# --- 7. ICMP Responder (Latency Simulation) ---
# Virtual IP for Ping/Latency testing.
# - If empty: Automatically selects a free IP from 10.200.0.x pool.
# - If set: Uses the specified IP.
# ICMP_RES_IP=
